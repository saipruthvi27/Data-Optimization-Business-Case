#### Rougir International Cosmetics(RIC)

Case study of RIC was used to etract, transform and load the raw data converting it to dataframe in.

The objective of the model is solving for minimization of cost and/or a key decision to make or buy for production to match excessive demand using linear programming model.

Key findings included constraints restricting the model and identifying the problem statement to design and build sensitivity analysis model. Based on the sensitivity model built in excel, insights were generated from the answer report. These key findings were crucial in providing recommendations to help grow in the cost-effective model in the fast-growing lucrative market.
